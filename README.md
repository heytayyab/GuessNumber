# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple and interactive number guessing game. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player's goal is to guess this number.

## How to Play

When you open the game, you'll see two messages:

- "I am Thinking of a number Between 1-100."
- "Can you Guess it"

Below these messages, there's an input field where you can enter your guess. After entering your guess, click the "GUESS" button or press the Enter key on your keyboard to submit your guess.

The game will then tell you if your guess is too low, too high, or correct. It will also keep track of the number of guesses you've made and the numbers you've guessed.

If you guess the number correctly, you win the game! The "GUESS" button will be disabled, and you'll see a message telling you that you've won.

## Responsive Design

The game is designed to be responsive, meaning it will look good on both desktop and mobile devices. On smaller screens, the layout adjusts for better readability and usability.
